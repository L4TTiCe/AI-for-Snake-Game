			<h3 class="question">What is Snake?</h3>
			<p class="answer">Snake is a popular computer game in which players control a snake within a grid on the screen and try to maximize their score. The score increases whenever the snake eats a fruit, which appear on the screen one at a time in a random position. Every time the snake eats a fruit, it grows in its size. The player loses when one of two conditions occurs: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>The snake crashes into a wall</li>
				<li>The head of the snake crashed into its own body</li>
			</ol>

			<h3 class="question">What is the goal of this project?</h3>
			<p class="answer">The goal of this project is to create an autonomous snake agent that is very good at the game.</p>

			<h3 class="question">How will this be accomplished?</h3>
			<p class="answer">Currently, the idea is to create a multilayer neural network that makes a decision for the snake at every frame of the game. The inputs will relate to how close the snake is from fruit, the walls, its own body, etc. Then, the output will be a decision of whether the snake should move up, down, left or right.</p>

			<h3 class="question">How will this neural network be trained?</h3>
			<p class="answer">Considering that the agent needs to learn from scratch, the neural network will be trained by learning its weights through a genetic algorithm. The details of the fitness function and the specific parameters for the GA are still being determined at this time.</p>

			<p id="final_note">Stay tuned for more updates about the glorious Autonomous Snake Agent!!</p>

This was a project to develop agents that are very good at playing the classic Snake Game. In summary,
the agents use a deep neural network to make a decision about which direction to move every frame, and
the weights for this network were learned through a genetic algorithm.

Check out the following website for a more detailed description of the project and demos:

There are 3 programs to check out in this project:
	
	playSnakeGame.py
		Try out the Snake Game yourself using the arrow keys!
	testTrainedAgents.py
		Observe some of the best Snake Game agents trained with the genetic algorithm!
	trainGeneticAlgorithm.py
		Observe how the process of training Snake Game access functions from scratch!

For more specific instructions for each program, please view the comments
at the top of the module.

***Dependecies***:
   1. Python version of 3.7 or higher.
   2. The Python library pygame.
        Type "pip install pygame" in the command prompt or terminal to install it.
        If necessary, more specific instructions for installing pygame are here:

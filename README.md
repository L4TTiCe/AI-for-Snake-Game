## AI Snake Agent

Adapted from the work of [Craig Haber](https://github.com/craighaber) with the original work available at 
[Source Repo](https://github.com/craighaber/AI-for-Snake-Game)

### Overview
Over the course of this project we intend to make an AI for the Snake game using various 
Path Traversal Algorithms (BFS, DFS, A* Search etc.), and attempt at making this game into an Advarsarial 
game where two agents, the Board and the Snake Agent can compete in a zero-sum game.

### Dependencies
